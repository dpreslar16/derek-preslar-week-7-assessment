# derek-preslar-week-7-assessment

This assessment takes data for holidays from https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/, allows users to manage holidays (add and remove them), saves a holiday list to a json file, and also takes weather data for the next seven days from Open Weather Map API (https://rapidapi.com/community/api/open-weather-map), listing out all holidays in the next seven days and the kind of weather it will be on that day (weather data is for Rogersville, MO).

The holiday manager can be run from the command line. The UI is text and will give instructions as needed. It validates user input as well; I haven't found any issues yet.
I have also attached a jupyter notebook I used to experiment with the code- this is not necessary to have for the program, but I thought I would include it to log my work.
The holidays json file is empty starting out, but the program will save the holidays to it.
